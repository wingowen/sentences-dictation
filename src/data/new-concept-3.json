        "美洲狮是从哪里来的？A puma at large新概念英语－课文Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America",
        "When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously",
        "However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar",
        "The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her",
        "It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered",
        "The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening",
        "Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits",
        "Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes",
        "Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree",
        "The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from",
        "As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape",
        "The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught",
        "It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside",

        "The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble",
        "It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet",
        "This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks",
        "The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphiné Alps",
        "As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable",
        "The cave might never have been discovered had not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French potholer, Berger",

        "After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to a narrow corridor",
        "They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools",
        "Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave",
        "They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side",
        "To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits",
        "At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water",

        "Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the potholers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall",
        "After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like tree trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof",
        "Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow",

        "They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem",
        "The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it",

        "But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers",
        "Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans",

        "If she were alive today she would not be able to air her views on her favourite topic of conversation: domestic servants",
        "Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework",
        "She had a huge, rambling country house called 'The Gables'",
        "She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death",

        "No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate",
        "The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust",
        "Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished",
        "She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names",
        "Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please",
        "While she always decried the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie",
        "Bessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years",
        "During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence, that she was put in charge of the domestic staff",
        "Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie's industry and efficiency",

        "Not only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily",
        "She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests",
        "When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force",

        "She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk",

        "In 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA",
        "It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future",
        "This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple",

        "From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today",
        "Considering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today",
        "Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days",
